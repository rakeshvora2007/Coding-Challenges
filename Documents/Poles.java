/*
Kevin was thinking about telephone poles and came up with an idea for a fun programming challenge. 
There are telephone poles ascending a mountain and each pole has a weight and a unique altitude. 
Our program must move the poles into k number of stacks, but we can only rearrange the poles according to certain criteria:

Poles can only be moved from higher altitudes to lower altitudes.
Stacks can only be formed at the initial pole altitudes.
A stack must consist of at least one pole.

import java.util.*;


public class Poles {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        //Number of poles
        int n = in.nextInt();
        //Number of Stacks
        int k = in.nextInt();
        
        //Loop all the stack values and thier respective weights
        for(int a0 = 0; a0 < n; a0++){
            int x_i = in.nextInt();
            int w_i = in.nextInt();
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n ; i++) {
            
            
            
        }
    }
}
